### [Secure at every step: A guide to DevSecOps, shifting left, and GitOps](https://github.blog/2020-08-13-secure-at-every-step-a-guide-to-devsecops-shifting-left-and-gitops/) 

<i>DevSecOps is the mindset shift to recognize and continuously apply security practices as part of the development lifecycle, with responsibilities shared across teams. This is frequently accompanied by shifting security testing left to earlier in the lifecycle as part of development. This keeps security‚Äîand developers‚Äîin the flow and in context, allowing security issues to be addressed earlier. And, by using Git as a source of truth for your environment, you can more easily apply these principles not only to your code, but also to everything around your code, like your configurations. By empowering all developers to take responsibility for security, performing security testing earlier in your development lifecycle, and using Git, you can help your development teams find and remediate security issues faster.</i>

### [Secure at every step: Putting DevSecOps into practice with code scanning](https://github.blog/2020-08-27-secure-at-every-step-putting-devsecops-into-practice-with-code-scanning/)

<i>Code scanning puts the developer experience first at every step. The static analysis engine at its core, CodeQL, is fast and powerful‚Äîcapable of finding real security issues without the noise. The queries it runs are precise, configurable, and are constantly being improved by the open source community. Results are displayed in in-line pull request comments, with detailed descriptions and remediation advice. All configuration happens as code in a GitHub Actions workflow file.</i>

### [GitHub Copilot: Your AI pair programmer](https://copilot.github.com/)

<i>Powered by OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code, and suggests individual lines and whole functions instantly.</i>

<li><b>Convert comments to code:</b> <i>Write a comment describing the logic you want, and let GitHub Copilot assemble the code for you.</i></li>
<br>
<li><b>Autofill for repetitive code:</b> <i>GitHub Copilot works great for quickly producing boilerplate and repetitive code patterns. Feed it a few examples and let it generate the rest!</i></li>
<br>
<li><b>Tests without the toil:</b> <i>Tests are the backbone of any robust software engineering project. Import a unit test package, and let GitHub Copilot suggest tests that match your implementation code.</i></li>
<br>
<li><b>Convert comments to code:</b> <i>Write a comment describing the logic you want, and let GitHub Copilot assemble the code for you.</i></li>
<br>
<li><b>Show me alternatives:</b> <i>Want to evaluate a few different approaches? GitHub Copilot can show you a list of solutions. Use the code as provided, or edit it to meet your needs.</i></li>
  
<br>

<i>Frameworks and languages supported: Does specially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Java, and Go, but it understands dozens of languages and can help you find your way around almost anything.</i>

<i>Available as an extension for Neovim, JetBrains, and Visual Studio Code - you can use the GitHub Copilot extension on your desktop or in the cloud on GitHub Codespaces.</i>

### [Enhanced support for citations on GitHub](https://github.blog/2021-08-19-enhanced-support-citations-github)
  
<i>GitHub now has built-in support for CITATION.cff files. This new feature enables academics and researchers to let people know how to correctly cite their work, especially in academic publications/materials. Originally proposed by the research software engineering community, CITATION.cff files are plain text files with human- and machine-readable citation information. When we detect a CITATION.cff file in a repository, we use this information to create convenient APA or BibTeX style citation links that can be referenced by others. I don't know where this was when I was back in uni.</i>

### [Create your GitHub contribution skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) 

<i>Want to see your GitHub contribution graph as a city skyline? Simply enter your GitHub @ handle and you've got yourself your very own 3D skyline based on all your commits for any chosen year. You can also print it - yes, print it. For those with a 3D printer, we have a .stl file for you to download. Make yours [here](https://lnkd.in/g4whEPV)!</i>

### [Game on? GAME OFF.](https://github.blog/2022-10-21-build-a-game-this-november-with-game-off-2022/)

<i>Game Off is an annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. Participate individually, or as a team. Use whatever game engines, libraries, and languages you like. The theme for this year's Game Off that has JUST been announced is.. BUG! Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create a game between now and December 1, incorporating the theme - in any way you like. Voting will open shortly after the jam ends and is open to everyone who‚Äôs submitted a game. Entries will be rated on the following categories: Overall, Gameplay, Graphics, Audio, Innovation and Theme Interpretation. 
  
Never created a game before? With so many free, open source game engines and tutorials available online, there‚Äôs never been an easier (or more exciting!) time to try out game development.

Check out [Game Off 2022](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024) for more info.</i>
